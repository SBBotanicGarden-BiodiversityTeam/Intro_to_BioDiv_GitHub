## What is git, GitHub, GitDesktop (or other version control system (VCS) GUI)

**git** is an open source version control system (already on your Mac computers - needs to be installed on others). A version control system basically has a way to keep track of the changes made to files, who made them and why, and to be able to go back to that if needed. It is used heavily by software developers but also helpful for us in bioinformatics where we are regularly updating and sharing code. 

**GitHub** You can think of it as the online *hub* or mother ship of where our groups code and set of instructions will live. You can `git clone` template repositories (GitHubs term for folder/directory) of code for projects to your local computer, edit them (say, changes needed for a new version of some program), then "push" the changes up to the mothership version where others on the team can approve changes and have them "merged" to mothership template.

**GitDesktop vs CLI**

*GitDesktop* is one GUI interface among several, (similar to Rstudio for R) that might be nice to use. I believe it at least has a command line window plus many of the capabilities needed to `push` and `pull` versions between local/main/master/your_laptop and remote/GitHub/mothership (that's as much as I know about it :bowtie: )  

*CLI* - Command line interface uses command on terminal to interface git and github.
