# Some basic instruction for creating repository with an .md (markdown) file
Once you are in the GitHub account, click on the BioDiv icon in the upper right and "Your repositories".  A repository is basically a folder where we can keep files. To create a new repository, click on the upper right green icon which will then prompt you to name your new repository. This one is named "Intro_to_BioDiv_Github" for example. 

To make a markdown file, click on the "Add file" at the top right of the inner window. This will open a fresh file where you can compose your new file. This can be a markdown file, straight code, etc. 

A markdown file help to keep track of your pipeline and parameters you used so that it is reproducible. **It is only as good as the extent to which you document it.**

Normal text can be written, well, normally with no hash (#)
