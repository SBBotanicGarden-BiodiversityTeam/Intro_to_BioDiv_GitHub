# Basic instruction for creating repository with an .md (markdown) file
Once you are in the GitHub account, click on the BioDiv icon in the upper right and "Your repositories".  A repository is basically a folder where we can keep files. To create a new repository, click on the upper right green icon which will then prompt you to name your new repository. This one is named "Intro_to_BioDiv_Github" for example. 

To make a markdown file, click on the "Add file" at the top right of the inner window. This will open a fresh file where you can compose your new file. This can be a markdown file, straight code, etc. 

A markdown file help to keep track of your pipeline and parameters you used so that it is reproducible. **It is only as good as the extent to which you document it.** To make a markdown file, name your file something descriptive with a `.md` end in the space at the top right. 

Before we get into formatting, the green Commit Changes button at the top right is key. Once you have written something in the window, click commit changes, click commit changes again. You will see the fruits of what you have written in html format and also essentially functions as a `Save` button. If you close the window with out commiting changes, you will lose whatever you just did before the most recent "Commit Changes". If you want to change anything click on the pen icon at the top right.
